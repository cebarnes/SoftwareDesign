O'DONOGHUE


It was in a poor little cabin somewhere in Ireland. It does not matter
where. The walls were of rough stone, the roof was of thatch, and the
floor was the hard earth. There was very little furniture. Poor as it
was, the whole place was clean. It is right to tell this, because,
unhappily, a good many cabins in Ireland are not clean. What furniture
there was had been rubbed smooth and spotless, and the few dishes that
there were fairly shone. The floor was as carefully swept as if the
Queen were expected.
